                <p>You can never reach your aims or goals without working hard. Hard work is defined as putting in maximum effort and showing maximum endurance. It is rightfully said that the only way you can guarantee success in your life is by working hard.

It has no other substitute. A person is put on this earth, not merely to survive, but to live. While you live, you develop certain aspirations and dreams. As a human being, one has to be committed to his or her desires and put hard work in the path to achieving them.</p>
